# Life-in-the-Netherlands
I am going to use Github as a dairy to record my everyday life in the Netherlands.
Today, I happened to find one of my favourit yogurts in a Germany supermarket named Lidl. This yogurt tasts really better than Dutch yogurts which
are usually acid. Ok, let's see

##ã€€**PS** 

1. the image link from dropbox must end with '?raw=1' or '?dl=1'
2. if image needs to be resized, don't use 
```![yogurt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r84fone6xmx1cj9/milbona-germany-yogurt.jpg?dl=1 )``` instead of 
```<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r84fone6xmx1cj9/milbona-germany-yogurt.jpg?dl=1" height="480" />``` 
3. we could upload pictures to the dropbox,then use the shared links in Github. It's really cool.
