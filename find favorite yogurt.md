Today, I happened to find one of my favourit yogurts in a Germany supermarket named Lidl. This yogurt tasts really better than Dutch yogurts which
are usually acid. Ok, let's see

Creamy yogurt with peach and passionfruit is made of germany milk.

In 2010,I stayed in the Munich as an exchange student. This yogurt gave me an impressive tast. I don't like pure milk(maybe a Chinese saying,I will correct it if wrong), so yogurt is almost the only option for me to consume milk products. However, the Dutch yogurt really suprises me by its pretty acid flavour which I can't put up with. Luckily I find this Germany yogurt. I will not worry about daily milk.

1. the image link from dropbox must end with '?raw=1' or '?dl=1'
2. if image needs to be resized, don't use 
```![yogurt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r84fone6xmx1cj9/milbona-germany-yogurt.jpg?dl=1 )``` instead of 
```<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r84fone6xmx1cj9/milbona-germany-yogurt.jpg?dl=1" height="480" />``` 
3. we could upload pictures to the dropbox,then use the shared links in Github. It's really cool.
